"""
Change counter!

1) Create a function, calculate_change(total_cost, total_paid) which returns float of change to give
2) Create function,  convert_tender(change_owed), which returns human-readable string of dollars, quarters
	dimes, nickles, and pennies owed
3) Create a function, main_loop(), that when run in the console will continually ask the user for a
	total cost and total paid then print the human-readable string of change
